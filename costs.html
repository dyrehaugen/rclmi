</ul>
<p>Extreme weather events lead to signiﬁcant adverse societal costs. Extreme
Event Attribution (EEA), a methodology that examines how anthropogenic
greenhouse gas emissions had changed the occurrence of speciﬁc extreme
weather events, allows us to quantify the climate change-induced component
of these costs. We collect data from all available EEA studies, combine these
with data on the socio-economic costs of these events and extrapolate for
missing data to arrive at an estimate of the global costs of extreme weather
attributable to climate change in the last twenty years. We ﬁnd that <strong>US$ 143
billion per year of the costs of extreme events is attributable to climatic
change.</strong> The majority (63%), of this is due to human loss of life. Our results
suggest that the frequently cited estimates of the economic costs of climate
change arrived at by using Integrated Assessment Models may be substantially
underestimated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Newmann &amp; Noy Memo*</li>
</ul>
<p>The EEA methodology compares the probability of an event that
occurred with the probability or intensity of the same event occurring in
a counterfactual world without anthropogenic emissions. From a
probabilistic perspective, a Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) metric is
calculated to describe what portion of the risk of an extreme weather
event occurring is the result of climate change. Methodologically, these
probabilistic methods have been approached from both a frequentist or
a Bayesian perspective5, with possibly important consequences for the
results thus obtained. We do not distinguish between these in our work
here, given the relative paucity of Bayesian attribution work. The attri-
bution approach based on FAR is known as the risk-based approach6.
The alternative intensity approach calculates what share of a speciﬁc
aspect of the risk (e.g., rainfall) was due to climate change. For instance,
the 2017 Hurricane Harvey’s climate change-induced economic costs
were analyzed by both risk-based7 and intensity-based8 approaches.</p>
<p>The economic costs associated with extreme weather events can
be measured in two ways: First, these include direct economic damage,
which occurs during or immediately after the event. Using ﬂooding as
an example, where the hazard is heavy precipitation, direct economic
damage may include destroyed housing and roads, or lost crops.
However, an extreme weather event can also cause indirect economic
losses. These are declines in economic value-added because of the
direct economic damage. Examples of these indirect losses are wide-
ranging. For the ﬂood example, they could include microeconomic
impacts such as revenue loss for businesses when access routes are
inundated by ﬂoodwater, meso-economic impacts such as temporary
unemployment in the affected area, or even wider-ranging macroscale
supply-chain disruptions. These indirect economic losses can often
spill out beyond the affected area, and indeed even beyond the
affected country/region’s borders. Indirect losses may also have long
time lags, making them difﬁcult to quantify. Generally, events that
cause more damage will also lead to more losses, ceteris paribus.
However, this relationship between direct damage and indirect loss is
nonlinear, with high-damage events causing disproportionately many
more losses as well. Because of these difﬁculties in quantifying indirect
(ﬂow) losses over a large variety of extreme weather phenomena in a
large diversity of countries/regions and economies (thereafter refer-
red to as countries for ease of exposition) and affected regions, this
paper only focuses on the more easily quantiﬁed stock of direct
damages.</p>
<p>By combining the data on direct economic damages, with the
attributable share of the risk, we can quantify the climate change-
attributable cost of these events. This attribution-based method for
calculating the costs of climate change (from extreme weather events)
differs fundamentally from other approaches to climate change cost
estimation. Those other approaches use macroeconomic modeling
embedded within climate models in various types of Integrated
Assessment Models (IAM).</p>
<p>Aim is to demonstrate the use-value of the methodology,
rather than reach an unimpeachable set of estimates.</p>
<p>Most IAMs are substantially under-
estimating the current economic costs of climate change.</p>

<p><em>Carrington on Newmann &amp; Noy</em></p>
<p>The damage caused by the climate crisis through extreme weather has cost $16m (£13m) an hour for the past 20 years, according to a new estimate.
It found average costs of $140bn (£115bn) a year from 2000 to 2019, although the figure varies significantly from year to year. The latest data shows $280bn in costs in 2022. The researchers said lack of data, particularly in low-income countries, meant the figures were likely to be seriously underestimated. Additional climate costs, such as from crop yield declines and sea level rise, were also not included.</p>
<p>The researchers produced the estimates by combining data on how much global heating worsened extreme weather events with economic data on losses. The study also found that the number of people affected by extreme weather because of the climate crisis was 1.2 billion over two decades.</p>
<p>Hundreds of “attribution” studies have been done, calculating how much more frequent global heating made extreme weather events. This allows the fraction of the damages resulting from human-caused heating to be estimated.</p>
<p>The researchers applied these fractions to the damages recorded in the International Disaster Database, which compiles available data on all disasters in which 10 people died, or 100 were affected, or the country declared a state of emergency or requested international assistance.</p>
<p>The central estimate was an average climate cost of $140bn a year, with a range from $60bn to $230bn. These estimates are much higher than those from computer models, which are based on changes in average global temperature rather than on the extreme temperatures increasingly being seen in the world.</p>
<p>The analysis used a statistical value of a life lost of $7m, an average of the figures used by the US and UK governments.</p>
<p>Only considering the economic damage caused to infrastructure would heavily skew the cost estimates to rich countries, despite much of the damage from extreme weather hitting poorer ones.</p>
<p>This study looks at the attribution for the physical event – it’s much simpler, robust, and it provides a convincing case. It is an emerging field and uncertainties are really large. One lesson of the study is that global research centres – mostly located in rich countries – need to work more on what is happening in poorer countries.</p>

<p><strong>Flawed economic thinking on climate has put your pension at risk</strong></p>
<p>Investment consultants to pension funds have relied upon peer-reviewed economic
research to provide advice to pension funds on the damages to pensions that will
be caused by global warming.</p>
<p>Following the advice of investment consultants, pension funds have informed
their members that global warming of 2-4.3 oC will have only a minimal impact
upon their portfolios.</p>
<p>The economics papers informing the models used by investment consultants are
at odds with the scientific literature on the impact of these levels of warming.</p>
<p>The economics of climate change is an interdisciplinary subject, but papers on
the economics of climate damages were refereed by economists alone. Properly
refereeing these papers required knowledge of the science of global warming that
economists typically did not have. Consequently, economic referees approved the
publication of papers that made claims about global warming that are seriously at
odds with the scientific literature.</p>
<p>These claims have been fundamental to the predictions by economists of minimal
impacts on the economy from global warming.</p>
<p>Economists have claimed, in refereed economics papers, that 6oC of global
warming will reduce future global GDP by less than 10%, compared to what GDP
would have been in the complete absence of climate change.</p>
<p>In contrast, scientists have claimed, in refereed science papers, that 5oC of global
warming implies damages that are “beyond catastrophic, including existential
threats,” while even 1oC of warming—which we have already passed—could
trigger dangerous climate tipping points.</p>
<p>This results in a huge disconnect between what scientists expect from global
warming, and what pensioners/investors/financial systems are prepared for.</p>
<p>Consequently, a wealth-damaging correction or “Minsky Moment” cannot be
ruled out, and is virtually inevitable.
Pension funds have a fiduciary duty to correct the erroneous predictions they
have given their members.</p>
<p>Similarly, financial regulators, who have used the same erroneous and misleading
economic damage predictions to stress test the exposure of financial institutions
to climate change, must drastically revise their stress test studies.</p>
<p>This report calls on all stakeholders, from governments, regulators, investment
professionals, all the way to civil society groups and individuals, to ensure that
climate change policy is based upon the work of scientists.</p>
<p>Climate change must be treated as a potentially existential threat to the economy,
rather than an issue which is suitably addressed by economic cost-benefit analysis.</p>

<p><em>Parshley</em></p>
<p>Insured losses from natural disasters in the U.S. now routinely approach $100 billion a year, compared to $4.6 billion in 2000. As a result, the average homeowner has seen their premiums spike 21 percent since 2015. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the states most likely to have disasters — like Texas and Florida — have some of the most expensive insurance rates. That means ever more people are forgoing coverage, leaving them vulnerable and driving prices even higher as the number of people paying premiums and sharing risk shrinks.</p>
<p>Reinsurers globally raised prices for property insurers by 37 percent in 2023, contributing to insurance companies pulling back from risky states like California and Florida.</p>
<p>In a worse-case scenario, this all leads to a massive stranded asset problem: Premiums get so high that property values plummet, families’ investments dissipate, and banks are stuck holding what’s left.</p>
<p>The global process for handling life’s risks is breaking down, leaving those who can least afford it unprotected.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the frequency of global natural catastrophes jumped by 28 percent. On a single day in July, 60 percent of the U.S. population faced an extreme weather alert. Costs have catapulted too: Since 1970, losses from disasters increased an average 5 percent a year, particularly in the United States.
Tragically, the fastest-growing counties also face some of the highest risks.
It doesn’t have to be one of these huge events. It’s [also] successive events, back-to-back - like the 12 atmospheric rivers that hit California this winter.</p>
<p>The reinsurance industry has paid dearly for much of the last decade; underwriting losses drove $115 billion in global reinsurance losses in 2022.
There’s a tension over a business model that’s retrospective, with a risk that’s emerging.
The financial foundation of insurance, in other words, is cracking.</p>
<p>Unlike insurers, who face political pressures from state regulators to keep rates affordable, reinsurance is much more of a free market.
Reinsurers are reacting by raising their rates, limiting their coverage, and even deciding to reduce their exposure in places like Florida.</p>
<p>Because getting risk wrong is now so costly, there’s been a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aay8442">race in the private sector to model future odds</a>.
This rush to fine-tune risk predictions may potentially accelerate skyrocketing premiums.</p>
<p>The economic implications of all this are troubling. A new <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1579">report</a> by the U.S. Treasury Department, released at the end of June, found major gaps in the supervision and regulation of insurers. The report advised much closer attention to “the risks the insurance industry may pose to the <a href="https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/perspectives-events/publications/2021/11/climate-change-impacts-to-the-us-mortgage-industry">overall financial sector</a>.”</p>
<p>As disasters continue surging, what they call the “growing climate bubble in the housing market” will pop — leaving millions of homes uninsurable and destroying their value.
If the value of their home plummets or if the credit agencies downgrade their communities we will have a lot of people trapped in places that are unsafe, economically trapped.</p>
<p>Insurers have played a major role in emissions for decades: Without insurance, fossil fuel companies have difficulty obtaining financing.
Insurers have been slower to move away from oil and gas, in part because it’s a larger part of many companies’ business.</p>
<p>It is difficult to understand how the industry can carefully price and manage climate risk in some areas of its business while simultaneously having no apparent plan to phase out its underwriting of and investment in the projects and companies generating the emissions that are causing these very harms.</p>
<p>The economic and insured losses over time are a clear indicator that the past is not a representation of the future.
With insurers themselves running out of insurance options, the stability of financial systems is far shakier than many realize.</p>
<p>Science is the easy part. Getting people to change their behavior, on the other hand, is difficult.</p>

<p>Climate change is going to cost us, said Kenneth Gillingham, a professor of environmental and energy economics at Yale. It will create an upward force on prices in many sectors. Some will affect us over the long term, but we’re already feeling them now. For example, air pollution and hotter temperatures.</p>
<p>We are more likely to have, say, ground-level ozone, which will lead to asthma cases and hospital admissions.</p>
<p>That could <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2023/10/27/health-care-costs-were-a-main-driver-of-inflation-in-september/">inflate health care costs</a>.</p>
